Trying out the SDL lib on cpp.


## Test game
A basic "game" to understand the essentials of the library. It also uses SDL_ttf and SDL_image.

## Runner
A pretty simple runner game, it tries to mimic Google's dino game. In this one i tried to play sounds with the SDL std library, it didn't work quite well. It also uses SDL_ttf and SDL_image.

## FlappyBird
Trying to replicate the game FlappyBird. It lacks many features, but the basics are there. For the sound in this game i used SDL_mixer, a nicer way to add sounds. It also uses SDL_ttf and SDL_image.

Not a game per say, but a really cool project.
